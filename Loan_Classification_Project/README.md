# Credit Risk Modelling - Loan Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that classifies loan applicants based on their likelihood of loan repayment. The model helps identify potential risks associated with loan issuance, thereby aiding in effective decision-making for financial institutions.
